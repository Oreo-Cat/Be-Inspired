            <strong>Hey there!</strong><br><br>
            Just so you know, Google Gemini 2.0 Flash and wrote most of the code for this website (With a bit of help from me and ChatGPT). I wanted to show just how advanced AI has become today. Despite this, it still took nearly 100 prompts to get it just right!<br><br>
            We made this site to give you a little boost of inspiration.<br><br>
